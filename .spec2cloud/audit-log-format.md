# Audit Log Format

The audit log (`.spec2cloud/audit.log`) is an append-only record of every action the orchestrator performs. While `state.json` captures the **current position**, the audit log captures the **full history** — useful for debugging, compliance, and understanding how the project reached its current state.

## Line Format

Each entry is a single line:

```
[ISO-timestamp] phase={phase} action={action} feature={feature?} iteration={iter?} result={result} details={details?}
```

| Field       | Required | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | yes      | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp enclosed in brackets. |
| `phase`     | yes      | The orchestrator phase that produced the event. |
| `action`    | yes      | What happened — one of the standard actions listed below. |
| `feature`   | no       | FRD / feature ID when the action is scoped to a single feature. |
| `iteration` | no       | Red-green-refactor iteration number (implementation phase only). |
| `result`    | yes      | Outcome: `success`, `failure`, `skipped`, `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`. |
| `details`   | no       | Free-text context (test counts, error summaries, URLs, etc.). |

## Standard Actions

| Phase              | Action               | Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| spec-refinement    | `review-prd`         | AI reviewed the PRD and suggested changes. |
| spec-refinement    | `review-frd`         | AI reviewed an FRD and suggested changes. |
| gherkin-generation | `generate-gherkin`   | Gherkin feature file generated from an approved FRD. |
| test-generation    | `generate-tests`     | Test scaffolds (Cucumber, Playwright, xUnit) generated for a feature. |
| implementation     | `implement`          | Code written or modified for a feature iteration. |
| implementation     | `run-tests`          | Test suite executed during implementation. |
| deployment         | `provision`          | Azure resources provisioned via `azd provision`. |
| deployment         | `deploy`             | Application deployed via `azd deploy`. |
| deployment         | `smoke-test`         | Post-deployment smoke tests executed. |
| deployment         | `rollback`           | Deployment rolled back after failure. |
| any                | `human-gate-approve` | Human approved a gate checkpoint. |
| any                | `human-gate-reject`  | Human rejected a gate checkpoint. |
| any                | `phase-transition`   | Orchestrator moved from one phase to the next. |

## Example Log

The following shows a realistic progression from spec-refinement through mid-implementation:

```

## Notes

- The log file is **append-only** — the orchestrator never modifies or truncates existing entries.
- Entries are written **after** `state.json` is updated, so the log always trails state by at most one action.
- The log is committed alongside `state.json` so the full history travels with the repository.
- To correlate a log entry with a state snapshot, compare `lastUpdated` in `state.json` with the log timestamp.
