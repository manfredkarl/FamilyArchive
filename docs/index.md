# Application User Manual

This documentation is auto-generated from Gherkin feature specifications
and Playwright test screenshots. Each page shows a feature as a visual
step-by-step walkthrough — the living specification of how the application works.

## Getting Started

Run the test suite to generate screenshots, then build the docs:

```bash
# Run tests (captures screenshots automatically)
npm run test:cucumber
npm run test:e2e

# Generate documentation from features + screenshots
npm run docs:generate

# Preview the documentation site
npm run docs:serve
```

## Features

*No features generated yet. Run `npm run docs:generate` after creating Gherkin feature files.*

*Generated by spec2cloud. Re-run `npm run docs:generate` after test execution to update.*
